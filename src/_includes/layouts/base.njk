    <section class="about">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I was originally born in Liepaja, Latvia. Moved to Ireland 2005 where I continued my pre school education. From a very young age I had a computer and have been fascinated by them.
      Naturally I was going to persue anything to do with computers, so in 2014 I had a taste test in college to see which branch of computing I would like to specialize in where I fell in love with 
      everything to do with web development. I now work full time as a proffesional web developer for a small software company.</p>

      <p>I enjoy many different hobbies outside of my passion for web development, such as hiking, lifting weights, gaming and reading books 
      to name a few. I consider my self to be open minded and welcome to any new ideas or experiances.</p>
